A [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) mod that hides the Windows Magnifier window while keeping zoom functionality fully working with Win + Plus and Win + Minus keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- **Complete UI Hiding**: Prevents Magnifier window from ever appearing
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Preserved**: Win + Plus and Win + Minus still work perfectly
- **No Taskbar Icon**: Magnifier won't show up in the taskbar or Alt+Tab
- **Fixes Mouse Cursor Freeze**: Eliminates the 5-6 second mouse cursor freeze that occurs when Magnifier touch controls appear on startup (a known Windows bug affecting users even without touch devices)
- **Blocks Touch Interface**: Hides the Magnifier touch overlay controls (semi-transparent squares at screen corners)

## Installation

1. Install [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/)
2. Search for "Magnifier Headless Mode" in the mod browser
3. Click Install
4. Launch Windows Magnifier (Win + Plus)

## Usage

Simply use the standard Windows Magnifier keyboard shortcuts:
- **Win + Plus**: Zoom in
- **Win + Minus**: Zoom out
- **Win + Esc**: Exit Magnifier

The Magnifier window will remain completely hidden while all functionality works normally.
